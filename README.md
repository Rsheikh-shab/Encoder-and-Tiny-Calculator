# Encoder-and-Tiny-Calculator

We used Python Programming Language to develop the encoder for converting asm file into hex file. In this assembler, all the registers (32 registers) and 3 types of instructions (R, I & J) are included. When user write the valid instruction, it will show Function type, Formatted binary, Hexadecimal(Hex) number and Binary number. The process will continue until user type “exit”.

Why “Tiny Calculator”?
- We named it Tiny Calculator because it can operate only Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*) and Division (/) with the remainder (%).
